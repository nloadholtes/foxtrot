Things to think about:

1. Playing with bootstrap
2. Heroku to GAE/EC2 services
3. Redoing RMR
4. --nevermind, not a good match for this project--
5. Passing off to a remote queue?
6. Running wildy different apps?
7. Testbed for random one-off ideas?
    7a. Aggregrator (public API's, etc.) of stats
    7b. Name Generator
    7c. Class based vs Form based views
    7d. Something in the ORM that encrypts data before it hits the disk?
8. Playing with tutorials (to test in a semi-prod environment instead of on a dev machine)
    8a. Following suggestions from the 2scoops book (env settings to prevent messy settings.py, etc.)
9. REST services
    9a. "personal" API
10. PhantomJS
11. SSL - Separate charge on heroku
