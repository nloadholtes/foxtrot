Things to think about:

1. Playing with bootstrap
2. Heroku to GAE/EC2 services
3. Redoing RMR
4. Changing to a non-web node
5. Passing off to a remote queue?
6. Running wildy different apps?
7. Testbed for random one-off ideas?
	7a. Aggregrator (public API's, etc.) of stats
	7b. Name Generator
	7c. Class based vs Form based views
	7d. Something in the ORM that encrypts data before it hits the disk?
8. Playing with tutorials (to test in a semi-prod environment instead of on a dev machine)
