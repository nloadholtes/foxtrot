Things to think about:

1. Playing with bootstrap
2. ~~Heroku to GAE/EC2 services~~ I think I have a good idea now
3. Redoing RMR
4. --nevermind, not a good match for this project--
5. Passing off to a remote queue?
6. Running wildy different apps?
7. Testbed for random one-off ideas?
 * Aggregrator (public API's, etc.) of stats
 * Name Generator
 * Class based vs Form based views
 * Something in the ORM that encrypts data before it hits the disk?
 * Running dxpx/PhantomJS on every commit to look at the changes of the site over time
8. Playing with tutorials (to test in a semi-prod environment instead of on a dev machine)
 * Following suggestions from the 2scoops book (env settings to prevent messy settings.py, etc.)
9. REST services
  * "personal" API
      1. ~~Github activity~~
      2. Bitbucket activity
      3. twitter
      4. ???
10. PhantomJS
 * Tests in general
11. ~~SSL~~ - Separate charge on heroku
12. Adding OAuth
  1. To keep user-personalization data from RMR?
  2. And to log into almost everything
